# OOP-JAVA
This is my work till date on the concept of OOP .
<br>
<br>
These all are my university lab assignments for the subject of OOP.
<br>
<br>
I have used the java language.
<br>
<br>
The brief discription and the problem statement about each of the program that I have done are mentioned below:
<br>
<br>
1)The "Bag" assignment:
<br>
A bag consists of zero or more objects of the same type. Each object can be described by its color and weight. Design a Java program to create a new object. This can be done in two ways. If the user provides information about color and/or weight of the object to be created then this information will be used to create the object otherwise the object will be created using default values for these attributes. Provide a facility to keep track of total number of objects and total weight of object from a bag. Use static variable and method, array of object/reference, and constructor overloading.
<br>
<br>
<br>
2)The "Complex" assignment:
<br>
Design a class ‘Complex ‘with data members for real and imaginary part. Provide default and Parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic operations(Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division) of two complex numbers.
<br>
<br>
<br>
3)The "Distance" assignment:
<br>
Define two classes to store distance. One of the classes should store distance in centimeters and meters and other should store distance in feet’s and inches. Read two distances, one for each class and compute sum or differences between them as par the user’s choice. Display answer in the unit provided by user. Use friend function, function overloading, constructors etc.
<br>
<br>
<br>
4)The "Runtime Polymorphism" assignment:
<br>
Design a base class 'Shape' with double type value and methods compute_area() for calculating the area of shape. Derive three classes: triangle, rectangle, and circle. Make compute_area() as an abstract method and redefine this method in the derived class to suit their requirements. Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle/circle and displays the calculated area. Implement dynamic binding for a given case study.
<br>
<br>
<br>
5)The "Exception Handling - Exhandling" asssignment
<br>
Implement a program to handle Arithmetic Exception, and Input Mismatch Exception. The user enters two numbers Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num2 is displayed. If Num1 and Num2 are not integers, the program would throw an Input Mismatch Exception. If Num2 were zero, the program would throw an Arithmetic Exception. Display the exception.
<br>
<br>
<br>
6)The "Matrix" assignment:
<br>
Design a class ‘Matrix ‘with appropriate instance variables and methods. Provide default and Parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform addition, subtraction, and Multiplication of two matrices. Find the transpose of an given matrix.
<br>
<br>
<br>
7)The "Inheritance" assignment:
<br>
Design the 'employee' class with a name, id, DOB,  mail_id, and mobile_no as instance variables. Inherit the classes: Programmer, Team Lead, Assistant Project Manager, and Project Manager from the employee class. Add Basic Pay (BP) as the member of all the
inherited classes with 97% of BP as DA, 10 % of BP as HRA, 12% of BP as PF, and 0.1% of BP for staff
club fund. Generate pay slips for the employees with their gross and net salary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
8)The "Factory Design Pattern" assignment:
<br>
Implement a Factory design pattern for the given context. Consider the Car building process, which
requires many steps from allocating accessories to final makeup. These steps should be written as
methods and called while creating a specific car-type instance. Hatchback, Sedan, and SUV could be the subclasses of the Car class. Car class and its subclasses, CarFactory, and Test Factory
Pattern should be implemented.
<br>
<br>
<br>
9)The "Strategy Design Pattern" assignment:
<br>
Implement and apply a Strategy Design pattern for a simple Shopping Cart where three payment
strategies are used Credit Card, PayPal, and Bit Coin. Create an interface for strategy patterns and give concrete implementation for payment.
<br>
<br>
<br>
10)The "Generic Programming" assignment:
<br>
Implement a generic program using collection class (ArrayList) to count the number of elements in a collection that have a specific property such as even numbers, odd number, prime number and palindromes.
<br>
<br>
<br>
11)The "File Handling" assignment:
<br>
Implement a program for maintaining a database of student records using Files.
Student has Student_id, name, Roll_no, Class, marks, and address. Display the data for a few
students.


1. Create Database 
2. Display Database 
3. Delete Records 
4. Update Record 
5. Search Record
<br>
<br>
<br>
12)The "Interface" assignment:
<br>
Design and develop a context for a given case study and implement an interface for Vehicles
Consider the example of vehicles like bicycles, cars, and bikes. All Vehicles have common
functionalities such as Gear Change, Speed up, and apply breaks. Make an interface and put all
these common functionalities. Bicycle, Bike, and Car classes should be implemented for all these
functionalities in their class in their way.
